The plant’s smell, resembling that of rotten flesh, is meant to attract pollinators like beetles and flies that are typically drawn to dead animals. When the garden announced the bloom’s arrival on social media on Friday morning, New Yorkers skipped work and canceled plans, rushing to bear witness to the natural wonder. It flowers only every three to five years after its first time, which can take nearly a decade. One visitor described the odor as similar to that of “briny, dead fish.' Another compared it to that of a dead rat. 'I was familiar with this plant but only in a textbook way, so this is special,” said Aprajita Singh, who was among the first to experience the gigas in full bloom.
